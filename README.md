# ðŸ“© SMS Spam Classifier  
ðŸ‘‰ [**Live Demo Here**](https://your-deployment-link.com) ðŸ‘ˆ  

## Purpose
This project builds a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**. It demonstrates how text preprocessing and natural language processing techniques can be used to detect spam messages automatically, which is important for improving communication efficiency and preventing fraud.

## Approach
- **Data Preprocessing**: Removed stopwords, punctuation, and performed tokenization.  
- **Feature Extraction**: Converted text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.  
- **Model Used**: Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luckypal24112004-coder/SMS_Spam_Classifier.git
